STARK-based aggregation of quantum-resistant signatures.  

This project explores zkVM approach for batch verification of multiple PQ signatures. The goal is compare proving time for different signature schemes, as well as benchmark vs other approaches (e.g. LaBRADOR) in terms of proof size (compression ratio) and verification time. 

Implementation details:
- ZKVM: Cairo
- STARK prover: Stwo
- Signature schemes: NIST finalist â€” Falcon (lattice based), alternative Sphincs+ (hash based)

## Roadmap

- [x] Falcon512 verification
- [x] Sphincs+ 128s with SHA2 (simple mode) verification
- [ ] Stwo proving benchmarks

Follow-up:
- [x] Sphincs+ 128s with Blake2s and 4-byte aligned address encoding
- [ ] Falcon512 with probabilistic polynomial multiplication checking
